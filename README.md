## Description

This project uses React to give the user some basic information on myself as a developer as well as some projects I have completed. It also gives the user the resources to contact me, whether it is to ask questions, give advice, or present opportunities.

## Installation

There should not be anything to install except if the user is interested in downloading my resume which is found on the Resume page by clicking the Download button.

## Usage

The user can click any of the links on the navigation bar in order to change from page to page.
